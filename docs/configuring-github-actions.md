# Configuring GitHub Actions
This page describes how to configure CI/CD jobs using GitHub Workflows. If you
are not familiar with CI/CD, read the following article for an overview:
[Using GitHub Actions for Python Applications](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2020/12/11/cicd-for-python-apps.html)).

## Overview: how to use this project template

1. Create a new repository starting from this template (using GitHub features),
   or fork the original repository
2. Choose a project name for your new deployment
3. Configure GitHub secrets
4. Run the `infrastructure` GitHub Workflow: this creates necessary services in
   Azure, in different environments
5. Run the `server` build GitHub Workflow: this builds the application and
   deploys it to the various environments

The instructions provided here illustrate the concepts using `Bash` scripts,
describing how to create a DEV environment in Azure: the same concepts can be
applied to provision other environments (e.g. TEST and PROD).

### Choosing a project name

The default name of the project is `Torino`. To create a new deployment
of this service, it is necessary to choose a different name.

Since Azure provides default domains for the services, the project name must be
globally unique. Note that the project name is concatenated to the environment
name, so for example a project name `example` will result in the creation of an
app service at the URL: `https://dev-example.azurewebsites.net`, if this name
is available.

The name should be set in `./infrastructure/template.bicep`, editing the
`projectName` `parameter`.

### Configuring GitHub Secrets

Before starting the first deployment, it is necessary to configure secrets in
GitHub, in detail:

* deployment credentials that are used by GitHub Actions to interact with the
  resource group in your subscription
* a database admin password, used by ARM templates deployments when creating the
  instance of PostgreSQL Server in Azure
* a database connection string used by the application server CD pipeline, to
  apply database migrations

This guide illustrates how to use repository's secrets, which are avaiable also
for free private repositories. Another option would be to configure [GitHub
environments](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/environments), but
this approach is not described here (the core concepts don't vary).

### List of secrets used by GitHub Workflows, for one environment

The following table lists the secrets that are required for a single `DEV`
environment:

| Secret name                 | Description                                                                 |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DEV_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION (?)  | Azure subscription ID for the DEV environment.                              |
| DEV_AZURE_CREDENTIALS       | Deployment credentials scoped for the DEV resource group.                   |
| DEV_DB_MIGCONNSTRING        | Connection string used for database migrations.                             |
| DEV_DBSA_PASSWORD           | DBA password used to create services in Azure (used in the ARM deployment). |
| DEV_API_APP_REGISTRATION_ID | App registration ID for the API.                                            |

#### Generating deployment credentials

Follow the instructions described here to generate deployment credentials and
configure them in GitHub secrets:
* [Deploy ARM templates by using GitHub Actions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/templates/deploy-github-actions)

**In summary:**

To generate deployment credentials, use the Azure CLI after signing-in to your
Azure account and selecting the desired subscription.

If the chosen project name is `example`, it is recommended to use a resource
group name such as `dev-example-rg` for the DEV environment.

First, sign-in using the Azure CLI and select the target subscription:

```bash
# login
az login

# select the desired subscription
az account set --subscription "NAME"
```

Create the target resource group, in the desired location:

```bash
RG=dev-example-rg

az group create --location "westeurope" --name $RG
```

Create credentials to automate deployments from GitHub Workflows:

```bash
SUBSCRIPTION_ID="3756d039-9ddf-4efc-9eec-11dec0d9ff59"
# subscription id can be found using `az account show`

# generate deployment credentials
az ad sp create-for-rbac --name "gh-agent" --role contributor --scopes /subscriptions/$SUBSCRIPTION_ID --sdk-auth
```

The output of the command looks like the following:

```bash
{
  "clientId": "*******************************",
  "clientSecret": "*******************************",
  "subscriptionId": "*******************************",
  "tenantId": "*******************************",
  "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
  "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
  "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
  "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
  "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
  "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
}
```

The whole JSON fragment must be copied and configured as GitHub secret, to
enable automated deployments in GitHub Workflows.

Note that since the credentials are scoped on the subscription, it is necessary
to define a secret for each environment. For the DEV environment, create a
secret such as:

* _DEV_AZURE_CREDENTIALS_ --> the name must match what is used in `.github/workflows/infrastructure.yml`

#### Define a database password

Choose, or generate, a database password for the DEV environment.

**Tip:** use Python to generate passwords, instead of make them up.
The following script can be used to generate passwords of 60 characters:

``` python
import string
import secrets


def generate_temp_password(length):
    alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
    return "".join(secrets.choice(alphabet) for i in range(length))


if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(generate_temp_password(60))
```

Example:

```bash
$ python3 genpass.py
SIqtKXqB8Pu61fuobHHBD1USt1m7dRXYR43EUJQvsX7oa79c4G4OSeuo4FPa
```

The database password configured in GitHub secrets will be used in
two ways:

* to configure the DB password when deploying the services in Azure
* to run database migrations

> Note: a possible improvement is to configure different credentials:
> the dba to run migrations, and credentials with lower privileges for
> the application server.

During development, it is convenient to have access to the database password of
the DEVELOPMENT environment, to work on the database structure using migrations
(described later).

#### Configure database secrets

Migrations need to run in the context of an admin user (able to create and
delete tables), therefore configure a secret in GitHub named
`DEV_DB_MIGCONNSTRING`, containing a connection string to the database. This
secret will be used to run migrations, which will run before deploying updates
of the application server. Storing this value in `alembic.ini` would be a
mistake since it includes a password.

Database migrations are run using
[psycopg2](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2/) driver, therefore the connection
string to the database server running in Azure looks like the following:

```
postgres+psycopg2://pgsqladmin@dev-examplepg:DATABASE_PASSWORD_HERE@dev-examplepg.postgres.database.azure.com:5432/example
```

Note that database name and admin user name are configured in the ARM template.
