# Common application settings, used by all environments.
#
# These settings are read in `app/program.py` and can be overridden by
# environmental variables, thanks to `essentials-configuration` package.
# Refer to https://github.com/Neoteroi/essentials-configuration for more information.
#
# The ARM templates provided with the project template configure properly the application
# settings, so nothing more needs to be done here.
